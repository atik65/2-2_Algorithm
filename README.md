## Course Description

This repository is a part of the Algorithm course offered in my second year, second semester at University of . The course covers a wide range of algorithms and data structures fundamental to computer science and programming. By creating this repository, we aim to provide a central location for students to access and collaborate on code related to the course.

## Algorithms Included

The repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures covered in the course. Some of the included algorithms are:

- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Coin Change -- minimum number of coin (Dynamic Programming)
- Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)
- LCS (Dynamic Programming)
- Fractional Knapsack (Greedy)
- Job Sequencing (Greedy)
- BFS
- DFS

These implementations serve as a reference and learning resource for students taking the course.
